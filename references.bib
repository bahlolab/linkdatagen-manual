It provides rudimentary error checks and is easily amended for personal linkage mapping preferences.Availabilitiy and Implementation: LINKDATAGEN is available from http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/linkdatagen/ with accompanying annotation files, reference manual and test dataset.Contact:bahlo@wehi.edu.au}",
